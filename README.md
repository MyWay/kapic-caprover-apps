## CapRover One-Click Apps

I am working on adding One-Click Apps to the standard [repo](https://github.com/caprover/one-click-apps), but for testing or the case that an app is not accepted, One-Click Apps will be available here. Once an app is accepted into the standard repo, I will remove it from this one to avoid having duplicates.

You can add new repository URLs to the one click app page. This one, is available as `oneclickapps.caprover.christopherkapic.com`.

_Note: Right now, I cannot get third-party repos to add to my CapRover instance, so to use one of my One-Click Apps, you must copy the app's `.yml` file contents and paste them into the `>> TEMPLATE <<` One-Click App in your CapRover instance._
